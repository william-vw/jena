Jena README
============

Welcome to Apache Jena,  a Java framework for writing Semantic Web applications.

This repository is a fork of [Apache Jena](https://github.com/apache/jena.git). 
Its goal is to implement a forward-chaining version of [Transaction Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_logic) into Jena's RETE network. 

Only the `jena-core/` part is impacted - refer to that folder for more information!
